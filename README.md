Frankensteined Check in system made in 48 hours during HC Summit!

How to Use:
1. Train your model on teachable machine (or anything else if you know how!)
2. Download the model for Tensorflow -> OpenCV Keras
3. Replace the model and labels file with your own
4. Add in firebase credentials (or remove if you don't want it!)
5. run `main.py` -> `python main.py`

I will be refining this and making it a professional app in the near future! If I haven't please remind me
